LESSON FIVE NOTES
S-MAC-K EDITION

-Note: This lesson seems to revolve around writing a specific program, temperatureConverter. See that for more.
-Notes may be sparse

-Accessor Methods
== Simple methods that access data in our objects and give it to our clients
-Client
== The name for a class or method that's using our class
-Get Methods
== Methods to get data from a class for their clients
== Typically preceded by 'get', i.e. 'getDegreesCelsius()' or 'getDegreesFahrenheit'
-Set Methods
== Method to let client change data in an object
== Also known as 'mutator methods'
-Expressions
== Combination of symbols that has just one value
== Performs calculations in Java and gives a single value as a result
== Often use operators to indicate what calculations to do and operands to provide information for those calculations
== Example: value1 + value2
== Example: a * (b + c)
-Operators
== + (Addition), - (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus)
-Operands
== Tells Java which value to use in that part of the calculation
== Examples: 4, 9.0, value1, a
-Statements
== Like sentence; Form a compete unit of execution
== Three basic types
--- Expression statements (like expressions)
--- Declaration statements (declare new names)
--- Control flow statements (branches and loops)

-Java's Expression Evaluation Rules (Like a dumbed-down Order of Operations)
== Java evaluates operations inside parentheses before operations outside of them
== If there are no parentheses, Java evaluates multiplication (*) and division (/) before addition (+) and subtraction (-).
== When there are multiple operations of the same priority, Java evaluates them from left to right
== Also: If either of the operands is a floating-point number, the result will be a floating-point number. If both are integers, the result will be an integer.

-Keyword: 'this'
== 'this' lets Java refer to the object that contains the keyword. When it appears with parentheses, it tells Java to call a constructor.
== Example: this(0.0)

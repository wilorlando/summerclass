LESSON FOUR ASSIGNMENT

I-HAVE-NO-IDEA-AND-AT-THIS-POINT-I'M-TOO-AFRAID-TO-ASK EDITION



"Using the example from the lesson as a starting point, change both classes as follows:

1. Add a method to TextWriter that clears out the variable textToDisplay, leaving it as an empty string.
2. Add code to TextWriterDriver that creates a third TextWriter object with some text in it and displays that text.
3. To test your new method, add more code to TextWriterDriver that clears the text in the third TextWriter object and displays it again to show that there's no text left."

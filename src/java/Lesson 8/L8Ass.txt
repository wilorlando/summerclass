This assignment concerns adding on to the temperatureConverter, so I just added it to temperatureCovnerterFour.
Starting to think I screwed up naming that, by the way.

ASSIGNMENT:
-Add one more new exception class to the temperature converter: InvalidTemperatureException
-This exception will thorw when the user tries to store a temperature below absolute zeor

-Suggested way to do it:
== Create a new class, InvalidTemperatureException
== Add a check for valid temps to each of the set methods, using a call to isTemperatureValid(). If the temp isn't valid, throw an InvalidTemperatureException. Also add a throws clause to the method declaration.
== Add InvalidTemperatureException to the constructor's throws clause
== Add a second catch block to the try-catch code in main() so that the program handles both exceptions there
